				<h1>Who we are</h1>
				<p>This is the website of 21st Hammersmith Scout Group, a Scout group based in West London. Our website address is: https://www.21sthammersmith.org.uk.</p>
				<h1>What personal data we collect and why we collect it</h1>
				<h2>Contact form</h2>
				<p>If you fill in the form on our contact page this information will be held securely using the Online Scout Manager system and made accessible to leaders so that they can contact you and access emergency contact details if you decide to come to a trial session. We keep this information for up to a year so that we have a record of the level of interest in the group.</p>
				<p>View the Online Scout Manager <a href="https://www.onlinescoutmanager.co.uk/cookies.html">privacy policy</a> and <a href="https://www.onlinescoutmanager.co.uk/security.html">data security policy</a>.</p>
				<p>
				<h2>Personal details form</h2>
				<p>If you choose to come to a trial session and fill in the personal details form, this information will be held securely using the Online Scout Manager system and made accessible to leaders. This is important for your child's safety in meetings and on trips, so that leaders can access emergency contact details and are aware of any medical conditions that might be important. If a leader no longer volunteers with the group, they no longer have access to this information.</p>

				<h1>How long we retain your data</h1>
				<p>We only hold personal information for as long as is necessary, and this is limited to what the group needs. When a member leaves the group we will delete their personal information. This means that if you leave the group and then rejoin you might be asked to provide these details again.</p>
